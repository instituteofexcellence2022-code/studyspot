## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well:
- ✅ Hybrid approach gives quick wins
- ✅ Mock data allows fast development
- ✅ Material-UI components speed up UI
- ✅ Code from Libraries module provides good patterns to copy

### Challenges:
- None yet!

### Optimizations:
- Can reuse card layout pattern from Seats for other modules
- Can reuse dialog pattern for forms
