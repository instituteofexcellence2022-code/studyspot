# üîß **FIX LOGIN/REGISTER ISSUE - INSTRUCTIONS**

## **Problem Identified**

Your login/register is failing because:
1. ‚úÖ **FIXED:** .env files were missing
2. ‚è≥ **TO FIX:** API CORS only allows https://studyspot-rose.vercel.app, not localhost

---

## **‚úÖ What I Fixed**

### **Created .env Files**
- ‚úÖ `web-owner/.env` - Created with correct API URL
- ‚úÖ `web-admin/.env` - Created with correct API URL

Both portals now point to: `https://studyspot-api.onrender.com`

---

## **‚è≥ What YOU Need to Fix (5 minutes)**

### **Update API CORS on Render.com**

The API currently only allows requests from `https://studyspot-rose.vercel.app`. You need to add localhost origins.

### **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:**

#### **1. Go to Render Dashboard**
```
https://dashboard.render.com
```

#### **2. Find Your API Service**
- Click on **studyspot-api** service

#### **3. Go to Environment**
- Click **Environment** tab on the left sidebar

#### **4. Find CORS_ORIGIN Variable**
- Look for `CORS_ORIGIN` variable
- Current value: `https://studyspot-rose.vercel.app`

#### **5. Update CORS_ORIGIN**
Click **Edit** and change the value to:
```
https://studyspot-rose.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3002
```

**Important:** 
- Use commas (no spaces) to separate multiple origins
- Include `http://` (not `https://`) for localhost
- Include both ports (3000 for owner, 3002 for admin)

#### **6. Save Changes**
- Click **Save Changes**
- Render will automatically redeploy your API (takes ~2 minutes)

#### **7. Wait for Deployment**
- Watch the **Events** tab
- Wait until it says "Deploy live"
- Usually takes 1-2 minutes

---

## **Alternative: Manual API Deployment** (If above doesn't work)

If the environment variable update doesn't work, you may need to update the code:

### **Option A: Quick Fix in Render Console**
1. Go to your API service on Render
2. Click **Shell** tab
3. This won't work easily, so use Option B instead

### **Option B: Update Locally & Redeploy** (Not recommended now)
This would require code changes and git push. Let's try the environment variable first.

---

## **üß™ How to Test After Fix**

### **Step 1: Wait for API to Redeploy** (2 minutes)
Check Render dashboard shows "Deploy live"

### **Step 2: Refresh Your Browser**
- Hard refresh Owner Portal: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
- Hard refresh Admin Portal: `Ctrl+Shift+R`

### **Step 3: Try to Register** (Owner Portal)
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/register
Name: Test User
Email: test@example.com
Password: Test123!
```

### **Step 4: Check Browser Console**
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Go to Console tab
- Look for any CORS errors
- Should see successful API calls

---

## **üìã Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before Fix:**
```
‚ùå CORS error: Origin http://localhost:3000 not allowed
‚ùå API calls fail
‚ùå Cannot login/register
```

### **After Fix:**
```
‚úÖ No CORS errors
‚úÖ API calls succeed
‚úÖ Can login/register successfully
‚úÖ Dashboard loads with data
```

---

## **üîç Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Still getting CORS error after update**
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check Render shows "Deploy live"
4. Verify CORS_ORIGIN has all 3 URLs

### **Issue: API not responding**
**Solution:**
1. Check API health: https://studyspot-api.onrender.com/health
2. Should return `{"success":true,"data":{"status":"healthy"}}`
3. If not, check Render logs for errors

### **Issue: Wrong credentials**
**Solution:**
For testing, you can register a new account.

Default test credentials (if seeded):
```
Owner Portal:
Email: owner@libraryname.com
Password: owner123

Admin Portal:
Email: admin@studyspot.com
Password: admin123
```
