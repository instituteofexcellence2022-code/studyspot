# 🔧 FIX BACKEND DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

## ❌ **Problem:** Backend deployment failing on Render

---

## 🎯 **QUICK FIX:**

The backend is failing to deploy. We need to check what's causing the error.

### **Option 1: Check Render Logs (Recommended)**

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your API service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Scroll to the **failed deployment**
5. Look for the **red error message**
6. **Copy the error and tell me what it says**

---

### **Option 2: Rollback to Working Version**

If the logs show errors with the new routes, we can rollback:

1. In Render dashboard
2. Find the last **successful deployment**
3. Click **"Rollback"** button
4. This will use the old working version

---

### **Option 3: Fix the Code**

Once I see the error logs, I can fix the issue and push a new commit.

---

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

**Go to Render Dashboard and:**
1. Click **"Logs"** tab
2. Find the deployment error message
3. **Copy the error text**
4. **Tell me what it says**

**Example errors might be:**
- Missing module
- Syntax error
- Database connection failed
- Missing environment variable

---

## ⏱️ **Until Backend is Fixed:**

Your student PWA is deployed but **can't connect to backend** because:
- Backend deployment is failing
- API is not responding
- Registration endpoint not accessible

---

## 💡 **WHAT TO DO NOW:**

**Tell me the error from Render logs**, and I'll fix it immediately!

Go to:
1. https://dashboard.render.com
2. Your API service
3. Logs tab
4. Copy the error message

**Then paste it here!** 🔧
