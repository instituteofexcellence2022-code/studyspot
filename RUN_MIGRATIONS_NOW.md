## üéä After Migrations: What to Do

### 1. Verify in Supabase
- Check Table Editor - see all new tables ‚úÖ
- Click on any table to see its structure ‚úÖ

### 2. Test New Endpoints

**In PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Test Audit System
curl http://localhost:3001/api/audit/event-types

# Test Dashboard Metrics
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/metrics

# Test GST Calculator
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/invoices/calculate-gst?amount=1000&gst_rate=18"

# Test Student Groups
curl http://localhost:3001/api/students/groups
```

### 3. Test Invoice Generation

```powershell
# Create a GST invoice
$body = @{
    user_id = 1
    library_id = 1
    items = @(
        @{
            description = "Monthly Seat Booking"
            amount = 1000
            quantity = 1
            hsn_code = "998599"
        }
    )
    gst_rate = 18
} | ConvertTo-Json

curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/invoices `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" `
  -d $body
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You See Errors

### Error: "relation already exists"
**Solution:** This is OK! It means the table was already created. The migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it's safe to run multiple times.

### Error: "syntax error near..."
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE SQL file
2. Check that you pasted it all at once
3. Try copying again from the original file

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project with admin access.

### Error: "column already exists"
**Solution:** This is OK! The migrations check for existing columns with `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`.
