# 📱 TRYING STUDYSPOTANDROID APP

**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Folder**: `/StudySpotAndroid`  
**Method**: Expo Web Mode

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MIGHT WORK BETTER:**

The `StudySpotAndroid` folder:
- ✅ Already has node_modules installed
- ✅ Same 30+ screens as `/mobile`
- ✅ Same React Native code
- ✅ Can run in web browser via Expo

---

## 🚀 **STARTING NOW:**

Running: `npx expo start --web`

This will:
1. Start Expo server
2. Automatically open web browser
3. Show the mobile app in browser
4. You can test all features!

---

## ⏱️ **WAIT 30-60 SECONDS...**

The browser should open automatically with the mobile app!

---

## 📱 **BACKUP PLAN:**

If this doesn't work either, we have these options:

### **Option 1: Just use the QR code from /mobile**
- The QR code is already showing in your terminal
- Open Expo Go on your phone
- Scan it
- Done!

### **Option 2: Deploy web student portal instead**
- The `/web` portal we built works
- Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
- Access from anywhere

**Watching for the browser to open...** 🌐🚀
