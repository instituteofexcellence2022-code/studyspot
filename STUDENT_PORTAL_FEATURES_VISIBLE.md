## 🔄 **THE PAGE WILL AUTO-RELOAD**

The React dev server watches for changes. After I commit, it will automatically reload and you'll see the updated sidebar with all 6 navigation items!

---

## 🧪 **TEST THE FEATURES:**

Once the page reloads, try clicking on each menu item:

1. **Dashboard** - Shows welcome message and stats
2. **Browse Libraries** - List of libraries (will be empty without API)
3. **My Bookings** - Your bookings (will be empty without API)
4. **AI Assistant** - AI chat interface
5. **Subscriptions** - Subscription plans
6. **Help** - Help page

---

## ⚠️ **WHY IT'S EMPTY:**

The pages are working, but show no data because:
- No backend API connected yet
- We added `.env.local` but you haven't restarted the server

**To see real data:**
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run `npm start` again
3. It will connect to the deployed backend API

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEP:**

**Watch your browser - it should auto-reload in ~10 seconds with the new navigation menu!**

Then you'll see all 6 student features in the sidebar! 🚀
