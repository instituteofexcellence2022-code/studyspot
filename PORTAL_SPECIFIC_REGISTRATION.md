# ✅ PORTAL-SPECIFIC REGISTRATION ROLES

## 🎯 THE ISSUE

**Problem:** Both portals were showing the same registration roles (Student, Library Staff, Library Admin), which didn't make sense:
- Students should use the mobile app, not web portals
- The Owner Portal should only have library-related roles
- The Admin Portal should only have platform administration roles

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### **1. OWNER PORTAL** (`web-owner`) - FOR LIBRARY STAFF & MANAGEMENT

**Available Roles:**
1. ✅ **Library Staff** (Front Desk, Operations) - DEFAULT
2. ✅ **Library Owner** (Full Access)
3. ✅ **Branch Manager**
4. ✅ **Finance Manager**
5. ✅ **Facility Manager**

**Removed:**
- ❌ Student (use mobile app instead)
- ❌ Platform admin roles (wrong portal)

**User Guidance:**
```
📝 Students should download the mobile app. 
   This portal is for library staff and management only.
```

---

### **2. ADMIN PORTAL** (`web-admin`) - FOR PLATFORM ADMINISTRATORS

**Available Roles:**
1. ✅ **Platform Support** (Customer Support, Operations) - DEFAULT
2. ✅ **Super Admin** (Full Platform Access)

**Removed:**
- ❌ Student (use mobile app)
- ❌ Library roles (wrong portal)
- ❌ Invalid `LIBRARY_ADMIN` role

**User Guidance:**
```
⚠️ This is the Platform Admin Portal. 
   Only platform administrators should register here.
```

## 📋 CHANGES MADE

### **Owner Portal** (`web-owner/src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
role: USER_ROLES.STUDENT,  // Default was Student

<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.STUDENT}>Student</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_STAFF}>Library Staff</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_OWNER}>Library Owner</MenuItem>
```

**After:**
```typescript
role: USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_STAFF,  // Default is Library Staff

<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_STAFF}>Library Staff (Front Desk, Operations)</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_OWNER}>Library Owner (Full Access)</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.BRANCH_MANAGER}>Branch Manager</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.FINANCE_MANAGER}>Finance Manager</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.FACILITY_MANAGER}>Facility Manager</MenuItem>
```

---

### **Admin Portal** (`web-admin/src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
role: USER_ROLES.STUDENT,  // Default was Student

<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.STUDENT}>Student</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_STAFF}>Library Staff</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.LIBRARY_ADMIN}>Library Admin</MenuItem>  // ❌ Invalid!
```

**After:**
```typescript
role: USER_ROLES.PLATFORM_SUPPORT,  // Default is Platform Support

<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.PLATFORM_SUPPORT}>Platform Support (Customer Support, Operations)</MenuItem>
<MenuItem value={USER_ROLES.SUPER_ADMIN}>Super Admin (Full Platform Access)</MenuItem>
```
