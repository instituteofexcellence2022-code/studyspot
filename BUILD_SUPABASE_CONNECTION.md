# 🔧 Build Your Supabase Connection String

## You Have:
- ✅ Project ID: `zgrgryufcxgjbmpjiwbh`
- ✅ API Key (anon key)

## You Need:
- ❓ Database Password

---

## 🎯 Two Ways Forward

### **Method 1: Get Connection String from Dashboard** (Recommended)

The connection string is on a **different page** than where you found the Project ID and API Key.

**Here's where to look:**

1. **You were here:** Settings → **API** ← This shows Project ID, API keys
2. **You need to go here:** Settings → **Database** ← This shows Connection string

**Exact Steps:**

1. In your Supabase project, look at the **left sidebar**
2. You should see "Settings" (⚙️) at the bottom
3. Click **Settings**
4. In the submenu that appears, click **"Database"** (NOT "API")
5. On the Database page, scroll down
6. You'll see **"Connection string"** or **"Connection pooling"**

**What you're looking for:**
- A section with tabs: URI, JDBC, .NET, etc.
- Click **"URI"** tab
- Copy the long string starting with `postgresql://`

### **Method 2: Reset Database Password & Build String** (If you still can't find it)

If you really can't find the connection string section:

**Step 1: Get/Reset Database Password**

1. Go to: **Settings → Database**
2. Look for **"Database password"** section
3. Click **"Reset database password"**
4. **COPY THE NEW PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY** (shown only once!)
5. Let's say your new password is: `MyNewPass123!`

**Step 2: Build the Connection String**

With your Project ID: `zgrgryufcxgjbmpjiwbh`

Your connection string will be:

**Option A: Connection Pooler (Recommended):**
```
postgresql://postgres.zgrgryufcxgjbmpjiwbh:MyNewPass123!@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

**Option B: Direct Connection:**
```
postgresql://postgres:MyNewPass123!@db.zgrgryufcxgjbmpjiwbh.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Note:** Replace `MyNewPass123!` with your actual password, and the region might be different (us-east-1, eu-west-1, etc.)
