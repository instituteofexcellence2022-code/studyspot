# ‚úÖ PHASE 3 COMPLETE: Unified Seats API

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Impact**: TRANSFORMATIONAL

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Consolidate duplicate seat endpoints into a single unified API with advanced filtering and real-time availability checking.

---

## üìä BEFORE: DUPLICATE ENDPOINTS

### **Old Structure** (9+ duplicate endpoints)

```
GET    /api/seats                        - Get all seats
GET    /api/libraries/:id/seats          - Get library seats
GET    /api/seats/available              - Get available seats

POST   /api/seats                        - Create seat
POST   /api/libraries/:id/seats          - Create seat in library

PUT    /api/seats/:id                    - Update seat

DELETE /api/seats/:id                    - Delete seat

GET    /api/seats/:id                    - Get seat details
GET    /api/libraries/:id/seats/:seatId  - Get library seat (duplicate)
```

**Problem**: 9+ endpoints doing essentially the same thing with context-based variations.

---

## ‚úÖ AFTER: UNIFIED API

### **New Structure** (Unified endpoint + convenience routes)

```
GET    /api/v2/seats                         - Get all seats (with filters)
GET    /api/v2/seats/:seatId                 - Get specific seat
POST   /api/v2/seats                         - Create seat
PUT    /api/v2/seats/:seatId                 - Update seat
DELETE /api/v2/seats/:seatId                 - Delete seat (soft delete)

# Convenience routes for backward compatibility
GET    /api/v2/seats/library/:libraryId      - Get library's seats
GET    /api/v2/seats/available               - Get available seats
```

**Solution**: 1 main endpoint + advanced filtering eliminates 8 duplicates.

---

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **1. Unified Middleware** (`api/src/middleware/unifiedSeatMiddleware.js`)

Created 4 unified handlers:

```javascript
// GET /api/v2/seats
unifiedGetSeats(req, res) {
  // Supports libraryId, zone, status, available, seatType filters
  // Real-time availability checking via EXISTS subquery
  // Replaces: GET /api/seats, /api/libraries/:id/seats, /api/seats/available
}

// POST /api/v2/seats
unifiedCreateSeat(req, res) {
  // Create seat with all context
  // Replaces: POST /api/seats, POST /api/libraries/:id/seats
}

// PUT /api/v2/seats/:id
unifiedUpdateSeat(req, res) {
  // Update seat status/zone/type/capacity/features
  // Replaces: PUT /api/seats/:id
}

// DELETE /api/v2/seats/:id
unifiedDeleteSeat(req, res) {
  // Soft delete (checks for active bookings first)
  // Replaces: DELETE /api/seats/:id
}
```

### **2. Unified Route** (`api/src/routes/unified-seats.js`)

Created v2 API route with:
- ‚úÖ Advanced filtering (libraryId, zone, status, available, seatType)
- ‚úÖ Real-time availability checking
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility routes
- ‚úÖ Proper validation
- ‚úÖ Authorization middleware
- ‚úÖ Logging and error handling

### **3. Route Registration** (`api/src/index-unified.js`)

Added unified route to main server:

```javascript
app.use('/api/v2/seats', unifiedSeatRoutes);
```

---

## üìñ USAGE EXAMPLES

### **Get All Seats**

```bash
GET /api/v2/seats
```

---

### **Get Library's Seats**

```bash
GET /api/v2/seats?libraryId=xxx
```

Or use convenience route:
```bash
GET /api/v2/seats/library/xxx
```

---

### **Get Available Seats**

```bash
GET /api/v2/seats?available=true
```

Or use convenience route:
```bash
GET /api/v2/seats/available
```

---

### **Get Seats by Zone**

```bash
GET /api/v2/seats?zone=A
```

---

### **Get Premium Seats**

```bash
GET /api/v2/seats?seatType=premium&available=true
```

---

### **Create Seat**

```bash
POST /api/v2/seats
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "libraryId": "uuid",
  "seatNumber": "A-101",
  "zone": "A",
  "seatType": "premium",
  "status": "active",
  "capacity": 1,
  "features": {
    "power": true,
    "wifi": true,
    "privacy": false
  },
  "pricePerHour": 25.00
}
```

---

### **Update Seat Status**

```bash
PUT /api/v2/seats/:seatId
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "maintenance"
}
```

---

### **Delete Seat**

```bash
DELETE /api/v2/seats/:seatId
```

---

## üìä IMPACT METRICS

### **Quantitative**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| API Endpoints | 9+ | 7 | 22% reduction |
| Code Duplication | 9 duplicate implementations | 4 unified handlers | 56% reduction |
| Maintenance Points | 9 locations | 4 locations | 56% reduction |
| Test Coverage Needed | 9 endpoints | 7 endpoints | 22% reduction |

---

### **Qualitative**

1. ‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth**: One place to manage all seats
2. ‚úÖ **Real-time Availability**: Live checking against bookings
3. ‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering**: Complex queries with query parameters
4. ‚úÖ **Consistent Behavior**: Same logic regardless of context
5. ‚úÖ **Easier Maintenance**: Fix bugs once, not 9 times

---

## üîÑ MIGRATION GUIDE

### **Frontend Updates**

#### **Old Code** (Separate endpoints):
```typescript
// Getting all seats
const response = await fetch('/api/seats');

// Getting library seats
const response = await fetch('/api/libraries/:id/seats');

// Getting available seats
const response = await fetch('/api/seats/available');
```

#### **New Code** (Unified endpoint):
```typescript
// Getting all seats
const response = await fetch('/api/v2/seats');

// Getting library seats
const response = await fetch('/api/v2/seats?libraryId=xxx');

// Getting available seats
const response = await fetch('/api/v2/seats?available=true');
```

---

### **Service Layer Updates**

#### **Old Service**:
```typescript
class SeatService {
  async getAllSeats() {
    const response = await api.get('/api/seats');
    return response.data;
  }

  async getLibrarySeats(libraryId) {
    const response = await api.get(`/api/libraries/${libraryId}/seats`);
    return response.data;
  }

  async getAvailableSeats() {
    const response = await api.get('/api/seats/available');
    return response.data;
  }
}
```

#### **New Service** (Unified):
```typescript
class UnifiedSeatService {
  async getSeats(filters: {
    libraryId?: string,
    zone?: string,
    status?: string,
    available?: boolean,
    seatType?: string
  }) {
    const response = await api.get('/api/v2/seats', { params: filters });
    return response.data;
  }

  // Convenience methods
  async getLibrarySeats(libraryId: string) {
    return this.getSeats({ libraryId });
  }

  async getAvailableSeats() {
    return this.getSeats({ available: true });
  }

  async getAllSeats() {
    return this.getSeats();
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

### **Legacy Endpoints** (Still Available)

Old endpoints remain functional for backward compatibility:

```
GET    /api/seats                        - Still works (redirects to /api/v2/seats)
GET    /api/libraries/:id/seats          - Still works (redirects to /api/v2/seats?libraryId=id)
GET    /api/seats/available              - Still works (redirects to /api/v2/seats?available=true)
```

**Migration Path**:
1. Phase 3: New endpoints available, old endpoints still work
2. Frontend: Update to use new endpoints
3. Deprecate: Remove old endpoints after migration

---

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "libraryId": "xxx",
    "seatNumber": "A-101",
    "zone": "A",
    "seatType": "premium"
  }'
```
