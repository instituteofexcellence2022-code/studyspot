**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

---

### 4. Missing Configuration Files - CRITICAL ⚠️

**Missing**:
- `web-owner/.env.example`
- `web-admin/.env.example`

**Risk**: New developers cannot set up environment

**Solution**: See `QUICK_WINS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` Section 1

**Timeline**: 2 hours

---

### 5. Limited Monitoring & Observability - HIGH ⚠️

**Current State**:
- Basic Prometheus/Grafana configs exist ✅
- No error tracking (Sentry)
- No application performance monitoring (APM)
- No log aggregation (ELK stack not configured)

**Required**:
- Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- APM for performance monitoring
- Centralized logging
- Alerting for critical issues

**Timeline**: 1 week
