## üí¨ Common Questions

### Q: Can I deploy to production now?
**A**: Not recommended. Critical gaps in testing (15% vs 80%), infrastructure (no K8s), and CI/CD (manual deployment). Risk of production bugs is very high.

### Q: What's the minimum to go live?
**A**: 
1. Complete testing (80% coverage) - 4-6 weeks
2. Setup CI/CD pipeline - 1 week
3. Create Dockerfiles - 1 day
4. Basic K8s setup - 2 weeks
5. Monitoring (Sentry) - 2 days

**Minimum timeline**: 8 weeks

### Q: What if I only have 2-4 weeks?
**A**: Focus on testing and basic deployment:
- Week 1-2: Core testing (routes, auth, booking)
- Week 3: Dockerfiles + basic K8s
- Week 4: Monitoring + deployment
- Accept 50-60% coverage initially

**Risk**: Higher bug probability, but manageable with good monitoring.

### Q: Can I start with Quick Wins?
**A**: YES! Highly recommended. Takes 1-2 days and gives immediate benefits:
- Better security
- Better monitoring
- Better performance
- Better error tracking

**See**: `QUICK_WINS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
