## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

Given the scope (7.5 hours of focused work), I recommend:

**Option 1**: Continue systematically (as chosen)
- Complete all 6 modules one by one
- Full testing after each
- Commit after each success
- **Time**: ~7.5 hours total

**Option 2**: Batch approach
- Build all 5 enhanced pages first (~3 hours)
- Test all together (~1 hour)
- Fix issues in batch (~1 hour)
- Commit all at once
- **Time**: ~5 hours total (faster but riskier)

**Option 3**: Critical modules first
- Seats, Payments, Attendance (most used) first
- Then Staff, Fee Plans
- Finally Dashboard
- **Time**: Same total, prioritized order
