## 🔍 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: Missing Pages in Sidebar ❌

**Pages that exist in App.tsx but NOT in Sidebar:**
- AI Assistant
- AI Recommendations  
- AI Analytics
- AI Scheduler
- Offline Payments
- Billing Templates
- Subscription Plans
- Subscription Manage
- Subscription Checkout
- Subscription Invoices
- All Credit Management pages (5 pages)

**Impact**: Users can't navigate to these pages!

### Issue 2: Wrong Section Classifications ⚠️

**Items in WRONG sections:**
- Smart IoT Control → Should be in "Smart Integrations" (currently in Operations)
- Face Recognition → Should be in "Smart Integrations" (currently in Operations)
- External Cameras → Should be in "Smart Integrations" (currently in Operations)
- Subscription & Credits → Should be in "Platform Billing" (currently in Finance)

### Issue 3: Confusing Labels ❌

**Labels that confuse users:**
- "Pricing Plans" → Should be "Fee Plans" (library's student pricing)
- "Revenue" → Too generic, should be "Student Payments"
- "Billing & Invoices" → Ambiguous (which invoices?)
- "Pending Payments Tracking" → Long name, should be "Outstanding Payments"

### Issue 4: Duplicate/Overlapping Pages 🔴

**Multiple pages doing similar things:**
```
Payment Tracking:
- Revenue Management
- Invoice Management
- Pending Payments Tracking
→ ALL 3 track student payments!

Invoices:
- Billing & Invoices
- Invoice Management
- Subscription Invoices
→ 3 different invoice pages!

Subscription Management:
- Subscription & Credits
- Subscription Plans  
- Subscription Manage
- Subscription Invoices
- Subscription Billing
→ 5 pages for subscriptions!
```
