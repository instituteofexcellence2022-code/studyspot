## 📋 REMAINING WORK: Based on Analysis Documents

### **From ULTIMATE_NAVIGATION_REDESIGN.md**:

#### Missing Routes to Add (Priority: High):
- [ ] AI Assistant → `/ai/assistant`
- [ ] AI Recommendations → `/ai/recommendations`
- [ ] AI Analytics → `/ai/analytics`
- [ ] AI Scheduler → `/ai/scheduler`
- [ ] Credits Management → `/credits`
- [ ] Smart Integrations Dashboard
- [ ] Student Groups → `/students/groups`

#### Redundancy Checks:
- [ ] Verify no duplicate "Subscription & Credits"

- [ ] Create single "Smart Integrations" page with tabs
- [ ] Group under one section

---

### **From EXECUTION_PLAN_NAVIGATION_FIX.md**:

#### Phase 2 Tasks (If Needed):
- [ ] Additional label improvements
