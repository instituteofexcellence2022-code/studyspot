## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### Technical Risks

#### High Priority Risks
1. **Scalability Issues**
   - **Risk**: System cannot handle expected load
   - **Mitigation**: Load testing, auto-scaling, performance monitoring
   - **Contingency**: Horizontal scaling, database optimization

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - **Risk**: Data breaches or security incidents
   - **Mitigation**: Regular security audits, penetration testing
   - **Contingency**: Incident response plan, security patches

3. **Integration Failures**
   - **Risk**: Third-party service failures
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback systems, error handling
   - **Contingency**: Alternative service providers

#### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Performance Problems**
   - **Risk**: Slow response times, poor user experience
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing, optimization
   - **Contingency**: Caching, CDN implementation

2. **Data Loss**
   - **Risk**: Database corruption or data loss
   - **Mitigation**: Regular backups, replication
   - **Contingency**: Disaster recovery procedures

### Business Risks

#### High Priority Risks
1. **Market Competition**
   - **Risk**: Competitors launch similar products
   - **Mitigation**: Unique features, rapid development
