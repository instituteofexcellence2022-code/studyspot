# 📱 STUDYSPOTANDROID - PROPER SETUP

**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Folder**: `/StudySpotAndroid`  
**Action**: Installing Expo properly

---

## 🔧 **INSTALLING REQUIRED PACKAGES:**

Running:
```bash
npm install expo expo-camera expo-location --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will install:
- ✅ Expo SDK (for web support)
- ✅ Expo Camera (for QR scanning)
- ✅ Expo Location (for nearby libraries)

---

## ⏱️ **WAIT 2-3 MINUTES...**

Once installation completes, we'll:
1. Start Expo server
2. Open in web browser
3. See the mobile app with 30+ screens
4. Test all features!

---

## 📱 **THIS WILL WORK BECAUSE:**

StudySpotAndroid already has:
- ✅ node_modules installed
- ✅ All 30+ screens built
- ✅ Complete React Native code
- ✅ Just needs Expo to run

---

## 🎯 **AFTER INSTALLATION:**

We'll run:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

And the mobile app will open in your browser! 🚀

---

**Installing now... watch for completion!** ⏱️
