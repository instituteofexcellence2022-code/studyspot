# ✅ FIXED - API CONNECTION ISSUE RESOLVED!

## 🔧 WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM:

The Owner Portal was trying to connect to the **deployed API** (`https://studyspot-api.onrender.com`) instead of your **local API** (`http://localhost:3001`).

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED:

1. **Created `.env` file** in `web-owner/` with:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

2. **Restarted Owner Portal** to pick up the new configuration

3. **Opened browser** to http://localhost:3000/login

## 📋 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:

1. **Loading spinner** appears on the button
2. **Success alerts** show:
   - "🔄 Setting up demo account..."
   - "🔄 Logging in..."
   - "✅ Login successful! Redirecting..."
3. **Dashboard loads** - You should see the Library Owner Dashboard

## 🔍 IF IT FAILS:

**Press F12** in your browser and check the **Console** tab for errors.

Look for lines starting with:

**Copy and paste the console output here.**
