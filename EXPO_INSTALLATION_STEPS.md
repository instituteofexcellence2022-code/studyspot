# 📱 EXPO INSTALLATION IN PROGRESS

**Status**: Expo needs to install first

---

## ✅ **WHAT TO DO NOW:**

In the terminal where you see:
```
Need to install the following packages:
expo@54.0.21
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

**Type: `y`** and press **Enter**

---

## ⏱️ **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**

1. Expo will install (takes 1-2 minutes)
2. Metro bundler will start
3. You'll see a QR code
4. Scan with Expo Go app
5. App opens!

---

## 📝 **ALTERNATE METHOD (If this doesn't work):**

If Expo installation fails or takes too long, try this simpler approach:

### **Option 1: Just Install Expo First**
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

### **Option 2: Use React Native CLI (No Expo)**
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx react-native start
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

---

## 🎯 **FOR NOW:**

Just **press "y"** in the terminal and wait for Expo to install!

It should take 1-2 minutes, then you'll see the QR code! 📱
