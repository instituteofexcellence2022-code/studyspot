```bash
# From /web/src/ copy to /web-owner/src/:
- components/ (exclude admin/)
- pages/ (exclude admin/, tenant/)
- layouts/
- services/
- store/
- hooks/
- utils/
- constants/
```

**For web-admin:**
```bash
# From /web/src/ copy to /web-admin/src/:

- pages/admin/
- pages/tenant/
- pages/common/
- layouts/
- services/

```

### **Step 2: Create App.tsx Files (30 mins)**

Examples provided in `RESTRUCTURING_GUIDE.md` Phase 2.

### **Step 3: Update Root Config (30 mins)**

    "install:all": "npm run install && cd api && npm install && cd ../web-owner && npm install && cd ../web-admin && npm install"
  }
}
```
