### **Option 2: Command Line (Alternative)**

# From project root
cd api

# Connect to Supabase and run migration
psql "postgresql://postgres.zgrgryufcxgjbmpjiwbh:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres" -f migrations/003_create_students_table.sql
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see "No students found":
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify migration ran successfully
3. Check Supabase "Table Editor" for data
4. Ensure API is running on port 3001

### If you see "Failed to load students":
1. Check API is running: http://localhost:3001/health
2. Check CORS_ORIGIN includes your frontend URL
3. Check database connection in API logs

### If API returns 404:
1. Restart API server
2. Check `studentRoutes` is imported in `index-unified.js`
3. Verify migration created the table
