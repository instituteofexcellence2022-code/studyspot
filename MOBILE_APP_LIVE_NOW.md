## 📝 **CHECK YOUR TERMINAL**

Look at the terminal where I started the Expo server:

**You should see:**
```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)
```

**If you see this - SCAN THE QR CODE!** 📱

---

## ⚡ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If QR code doesn't work:**
1. Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi
2. Try the `exp://` URL instead
3. Or use: `npx expo start --tunnel` (works over internet)

### **If app shows errors:**
- First load takes 30-60 seconds to compile
- Wait for "Bundling complete"
- Then try again

## 🎉 **ONCE IT OPENS:**

The mobile app will load and you'll see the **onboarding screens**!

**Try these features:**
1. Swipe through onboarding
2. Register as a student
3. Browse libraries
4. Try booking a seat
5. Scan QR code
6. Chat with AI
7. Check gamification

---

## 📱 **YOUR MOBILE APP IS LIVE!**

Share the QR code or `exp://` URL with anyone who has Expo Go:
- They can open your app immediately
- No installation needed
- Works on Android & iOS
- Updates automatically

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS (Optional):**

Want a standalone APK?
```bash
eas login
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This builds an APK file that works without Expo Go!

**Check your terminal for the QR code and open the app on your phone!** 📱🎉
