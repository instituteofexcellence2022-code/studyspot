## 📍 Current Step: Issue #1

**We're starting here:** Database Setup (PostgreSQL via Supabase)

---

# 🎯 ISSUE #1: Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

## Problem
- Currently using SQLite (local file, not production-ready)
- Need PostgreSQL for production (scalable, reliable)

## Solution
- Use **Supabase** (FREE PostgreSQL database)
- 500 MB storage free
- Connection pooling included
- Automatic backups

## What You'll Get
- ✅ Production-grade PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Automatic backups
- ✅ SSL connections
- ✅ Web dashboard to manage data
- ✅ API for direct access
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions (bonus!)

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1.1: Create Supabase Account** (5 min)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com
2. Click **"Start your project"**
3. Sign up with:
   - GitHub account (recommended), OR
   - Email + password

### **Step 1.2: Create New Project** (5 min)

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `studyspot-production`
   - **Database Password:** (Generate a strong one - SAVE THIS!)
   - **Region:** Choose closest to your users
   - **Pricing Plan:** Free (default)
3. Click **"Create new project"**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for setup

### **Step 1.3: Get Database Connection String** (2 min)

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Database**
2. Find **"Connection string"** section
3. Select **"URI"** tab
4. Copy the connection string (looks like):
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password

### **Step 1.4: Save Credentials** (2 min)

I'll create a secure file for you to store this.

### **Step 1.5: Run Database Migrations** (10-15 min)

Once you have the connection string, we'll:
1. Update API configuration
2. Run migrations to create all tables
3. Test connection
