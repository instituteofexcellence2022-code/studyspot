# üîç PROFESSIONAL CODE REVIEW - AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM

## üìã ISSUE SUMMARY:
User reports: "‚ùå Login failed. Cannot connect to server" despite API running on localhost:3001

---

## ‚úÖ SYSTEMATIC DIAGNOSIS:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **VERIFY API SERVER STATUS**
```bash
API Server: Running on port 3001 ‚úÖ (PID: 18372)
Health Check: http://localhost:3001/health responds with 200 OK ‚úÖ
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **VERIFY FRONTEND SERVER STATUS**
```bash
Owner Portal: Running on port 3000 ‚úÖ (PID: 9220)
Compiled successfully ‚úÖ
No TypeScript errors ‚úÖ
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **VERIFY ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION**
```bash
File: web-owner/.env
Content: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **ISSUE: REACT_APP_* ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

**üö® CRITICAL FINDING:**

React Create App requires:
1. ‚úÖ `.env` file must be present BEFORE server starts
2. ‚úÖ Variable MUST start with `REACT_APP_`
3. ‚ùå **SERVER MUST BE RESTARTED after creating .env**
4. ‚ùå **BROWSER CACHE must be cleared**

**POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE:**
The frontend code is still using the HARDCODED default value:
```typescript
BASE_URL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
```

If `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` is undefined at build time, it falls back to the default. BUT the issue is the user might still have the DEPLOYED API URL cached from previous builds.

Let me create a DIAGNOSTIC page that shows EXACTLY what API URL the frontend is using.
