## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Page is blank**

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're on the Dashboard
3. Try clicking different buttons
4. If still not working, refresh page

### **Issue: Features don't work (search, filter, etc.)**
**Solution**:
1. This is **mock data** - features work client-side only
2. Changes **won't persist** on page reload
3. This is expected for 60% phase
4. Backend integration will be Phase 3

### **Issue: "Module not found" errors**
**Solution**:
```bash
cd web-owner
npm install
npm start
```

### **Issue: Port 3000 already in use**
