# ✅ ALL PAGES ARE NOW VISIBLE!

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

**Problem**: Sidebar was filtering pages by role, but looking for `'library_admin'` which doesn't exist.  
**Solution**: Changed all roles to `'library_owner'` (the correct role from Skip Login).  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and pushed to GitHub (commit: 333fb05)

4. It should be `'library_owner'`
