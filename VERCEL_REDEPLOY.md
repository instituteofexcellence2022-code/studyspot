# ðŸš€ Vercel Redeployment Instructions

## Issue
Getting "Loading chunk 8185 failed" error on https://studyspot-librarys.vercel.app

## Root Cause
Vercel is serving old build artifacts. The latest code pushed to GitHub isn't deployed yet.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Recommended)
Vercel should automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub. Wait 2-5 minutes after your push.

**Check deployment status**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: studyspot-librarys
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for latest deployment triggered by commit `0ee5300`

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
If auto-deploy didn't trigger:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click the "..." menu on latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"

### Option 3: Force Redeploy via Git
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger vercel redeploy"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Timeline
- Push detected: Immediate
- Build starts: 10-30 seconds
- Build completes: 1-2 minutes
- Deployment: 30-60 seconds
- **Total**: 2-4 minutes

## Verify Deployment
Once deployed, check:
1. Visit: https://studyspot-librarys.vercel.app
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
3. Check console for errors
4. Try logging in

## If Still Not Working
Add chunk error handling (see below)
