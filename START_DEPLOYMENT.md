PORT = 10000
```

#### 2. Database (Open api/.env and copy your DATABASE_URL)

DATABASE_URL = <paste from api/.env>
```

#### 3. Redis (Copy from api/.env)
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL = <paste from api/.env>
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN = <paste from api/.env>
```

#### 4. JWT Secrets (Copy from api/.env)
```
JWT_SECRET = <paste from api/.env>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET = <paste from api/.env>
ENCRYPTION_KEY = <paste from api/.env>
SESSION_SECRET = <paste from api/.env>
```

#### 5. Cloudinary (Copy from api/.env)
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = <paste from api/.env>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = <paste from api/.env>

### F. Create Service & Deploy!

1. Scroll down
2. Click **"Create Web Service"**
3. Wait 3-5 minutes while Render:
   - Clones your repository
   - Installs dependencies
   - Starts your API

**Watch the logs!** You'll see:
- `npm install` running
- `Starting server...`
- `Server running on port 10000`

---

### G. Test Your API

Once deployed (status shows "Live"):

1. Copy your API URL (looks like: `https://studyspot-api.onrender.com`)
2. Add `/health` to the end
3. Visit: `https://studyspot-api.onrender.com/health`

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T..."
}
```

‚úÖ **If you see this, YOUR API IS LIVE!** üéâ
