## 🔍 WHY THIS HAPPENS

**React apps bundle JavaScript into chunks**. When you make code changes:
1. ✅ Code is updated on server
2. ❌ Browser still has old JavaScript cached
3. ⚠️ Browser uses cached code (old version)
4. ✅ Hard refresh forces browser to download new code

**This is normal in development!**
